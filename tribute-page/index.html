               <i>"I remember when, as a kid, I got my first real basketball.

                I loved the feel of it in my hands. I was so enamored with the ball that I didn’t actually want to bounce it or use it, because I didn’t want to ruin the pebbled leather grains or the perfect grooves. I didn’t want to ruin the feel.
                
                Those are some of the elements that I loved about the ball, about the game. They were at the core and root of my process and craft.They were the reasons I went through all that I went through, put in all that I put in, dug as deep as I dug.
                
                It all came back to that special tap, tap, tap that I first grew infatuated with as a boy."</i>
